/*
Vector:
Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size.
Just like arrays, vectors use contiguous storage locations for their elements, which means that their elements can also be accessed directly in O(1) time.
But unlike arrays, their size can change dynamically, with their storage begin handled automatically by the container.
